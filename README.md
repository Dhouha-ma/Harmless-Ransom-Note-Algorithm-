# Harmless-Ransom-Note-Algorithm

It's a note made from words cut out of a magazine. 
The function will take two parameters ' noteText' and 'magazineText' 
The purpose is to check if we have enough words in our magazine to create the note. 
if we do, the algorithm should return true, if not it will return false.
